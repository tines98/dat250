* I had no technical problems when installing the software
* I validated the software development environment by creating a simple Hello World script
* I had no issues with the heroku platform
* In the getting started guide of heroku, it asked to use paper-trail, which needed 
me to enter my credit card information, which I didn't want to do, So I stopped there.
